                    <hr>
                    <p>This Neil is an American actor, producer, singer, comedian, magician, and television host. He is known for playing Barney Stinson in the television comedy series <a href="#">How I Met Your Mother</a>, for which he was nominated for four Emmy Awards, and for his role as the title character in Doogie Howser, M.D. That's great and all, but does he wear a tie with our solar system on it? No.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>This particlular Neil is an American singer-songwriter and musician with a career that began in the 1960s. Diamond has sold <a href="#">over 100 million records worldwide</a>, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.

                    <p>Here's another Neil that can sing. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as "one of rock and roll's greatest songwriters and performers". He was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice, first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of <a href="#">Buffalo Springfield</a> in 1997.

                    <p>This is a picture of Neil dGT as a very badass young man. This photo was probably taken minutes before he officially became the coolest Neil in the universe. His <a href="#">space t-shirt</a> most likely helped moved him from second-coolest to coolest.</p>
